Project

Here I will post info regarding the project

The project has targets that are going to be achieved. Here are some of them:

1. Create classes for all shapes and regions (Ellipse, Circle, Rectangle, Polygon, Line, Polyline).
2. Create a class that is going to manage all the created shapes (ShapeManager.class).
3. <Optional> Use Decorator pattern for the creation of shapes:
4. Add a new class Creator for all shapes (RectangleCreator, CricleCreator, etc ). The purpose of this class is to create a shape from a given input, wrapped as a string.
  Ex: rectangle green 2 yellow 5 5 20 40 -> creates a rectangle in this input rectangle <fill> <stroke-width> <stroke-color> <x> <y> <width> <height> <rx> <ry>, where rx and ry stand for rounded angle radiuses.
5. Use Flyweight pattern to avoid creating duplicate objects.
6. Create a class that will manage the translation of the object. In this project, we will only cover the transformation principle of an object.
7. Create a class that will print the values in the console/terminal.
8. Develop a class that will search for all shapes that fall in a certain region presented by a circle or rectangle.
9. Develop an erase function, that will erase objects from the ShapeManager.class.
10. Use singleton to open a one-only file, that will not change unless a function closed is initialized.
11. Create a function that will parse all the text in a file from the input.
12. Create a function that will read from file.
13. If the file is an SVG, read all the shapes. Reverse engineer the process of the Creator classes.
14. Again send the result to the manager class.
15. Adjust the menu to look better.
